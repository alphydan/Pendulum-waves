This is a little python script to calculate the length of the penduli
used in creating a pendulum wave (a really cool physics experiment).

(not my pendulum).

The idea for our penduli came from Nic Harrigan (http://nicholasharrigan.com/)


<<< Theory >>>

We have a pendulum with 

length "l_0"
mass   "m"
and therefore period of   t_0  = 2 * Pi * sqrt(l_0/g)   (for small angles)
We want it to do n_0 oscillations during period T = t_0*n_0.

For pendulum 1, we want it to do "n_0-1" oscillations during T
for pendulum 2, we want it to do "n_0-2" oscillations during T
etc ...
