This is a little python script to calculate the length of the penduli
used in creating a pendulum wave (a really cool physics experiment).

To see some demos check out these videos:



(not my pendulum).
The idea for our penduli came from Nic Harrigan (         )


<<< Theory >>>

We have a pendulum with 

length "l_0"
mass   "m"

and therefore period of
